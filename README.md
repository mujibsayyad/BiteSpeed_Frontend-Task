## Project Setup

Please follow the instructions below to setup the project:

### Clone the Repository

First, we need to clone the repository. Open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/mujibsayyad/BiteSpeed_Frontend-Task.git
```

### Navigate into the Project Directory

Once cloning is complete, navigate into the new project directory with this command:

```
cd Chatbot flow builder
```

### Install Dependencies

Now we'll install the project's dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install

or

```
yarn
```

or

```
bun i
```

### Start the Development Server

Finally, start the development server with this command:

yarn dev
```

or

```
bun dev
```

The project should now be running at
